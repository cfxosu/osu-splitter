## Additional Notes

The application reads beatmap data directly from osu!'s memory while the game is running, making it highly responsive and accurate. You can split beatmaps into 2â€“100 parts based on hit object count. The tool also supports automatic difficulty naming and creates .osz archives for easy import.
