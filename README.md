## Download

https://github.com/cfxosu/osu-splitter/releases/tag/osu-splitter-1.0

## Additional Notes

The application reads beatmap data directly from osu! memory while the game is running, making it incredibly responsive and accurate. You can split beatmaps into 2-100 parts based on hit object count, with automatic difficulty naming and .osz archive creation for easy import.
